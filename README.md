<h2>Description</h2>
 
  I will be setting up a robust vulnerability management server utilizing OpenVAS. Following this, a virtual machine will be created and configured in Azure.On the virtual machine, I will install outdated software to conduct comprehensive scans, subsequently implementing effective remediation strategies to address any identified vulnerabilities. This approach ensures proactive and efficient vulnerability management, optimizing security measures for the entire system.
